# Loops
Loops are the core of programming and what makes programming useful, because something can be iterated without a human doing it for every data.


Tools neede for loops like range(), xrange() and such


Kurzgesagt, there are **3 kinds of loops** in Py:
- For loop
- While loop
- Nested loop

## For loop
The `for` loop is used for iterating over a sequence (list, tuple, dictionary, set, and string).<br/>
Easy example: (this is used to print (command print can be replaced with other stuffs) every member of straw hats, uhm I mean member of a list. `Garp` can be any variable name. 
```python
mugiwara = ['Luffy','Zoro','Sanji']
for Garp in mugiwara:
  print(Garp)
```

## While loop
The `while` loop is used for executing a set of commands as long as a certain condition is still True.
Easy example:
```python
Nami = 1
while Nami < 6:
  print(Nami)
  Nami += 2
```
Result:
```
1
3
5
```
