# Conditionals
There are several logical conditions that can be used to make statement in Py.
| Condition | Symbol |
|---|---|
| Equal | `a == b` |
|Not equal|`a != b`|
|Less than|`a < b`|
|Less than or equal to|`a <= b`|
|Greater than|`a > b`|
|Greater than or equal to|`a >= b`|

Logical operators are also can be used in statements. There are 3 basic logical operators:<br/>
- `AND` = both of the conditions have to be True so that the whole statement is True.
- `OR` = only one of the conditions that have to be True so that the whole statement is True.
- `NOT` = the opposite condition have to be True so that the whole statement is True.

Here are truth table for `AND`, `OR`, and `NOT`:
|A|B|AND|OR|NOT(A)|NOT(B)|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|T|T|T|T|F|F|
|T|F|F|T|F|T|
|F|T|F|T|T|F|
|F|F|F|F|T|T|

There are **4** types of conditionals:
- If statement
- If-Else statement
- If-Elif-Else statement
- Nested if statement

Before jumping into those conditionals, here are some **anti-syntax-frustration tips** on Py conditionals:
- Make sure your conditionals are in lowercase (`if` and `else` instead of `If` and `Else`). Remember, Py is case-sensitive. At one time, I spent half hour finding out why I got syntax error on a very simple conditional practice, it turns out it was this simple problem ðŸ˜”.
- Put `:` after putting your conditions. The `:` has meaning that this line has some "operations" inside. 
- Don't forget to put tab before the actions after the conditional. These tabbed lines are the "operations".
- For condition "if something equals something" format, use `==` instead of `=`. These two are different. `=` is used to define a variable, while `==` literally means equal.

## If Statement
If this condition is true, do something. If this condition is not true, do nothing and move on to the next thing.<br/>
```python
k = 20
if k > 22:
    print("Oh no I'm getting old")
print('They said age is only number')
```

## If-Else Statement
If A condition is NOT true, try B condition first. 
```python
#Type your answer here.
name= input('Please input your name')
if name == 'Bond':
    print('Welcome on board 007')
else:
    print('Good Morning ',name)
```

## If-Elif-Else Statement
If A condition is NOT true, try B condition. If still not true, try C conditions, etc. Elif statements can be stacked.<br/>
Elif statement is like a prince going to a village and knocking on every villager's door to find a beautiful suitor (beautiful can also be from the insideðŸ’–). He had a certain standard for a beautiful suitor, so whenever he found a villager under his standard, he would knock another door. If he knocked the `else` door and he still didn't find any suitor that meet his standard... well maybe his soulmate is in another village/town.
```python
char = 'Chopper'
if char == 'Luffy':
    print('gomu')
elif char == 'Usopp':
    print('sogeking')
elif char == 'Zoro':
    print('onigiri')
elif char == 'Robin':
    print('fleur')
elif char == 'Franky':
    print('Cola')
else:
    print('rumble')
```

## Nested If Statement
This is different from elif statement. Nested if statement is like extra security doors that guests need to go through to meet the king ðŸ‘‘ and not every guest can be allowed to meet the king ðŸ‘‘. Only guest that meet all requirements can pass all the doors and meet the king ðŸ‘‘
```python
numbers = [1,3,4,6,7,8,9,12]

# Make for loop
for luffy in numbers:
    # Condition 1: is the number is odd?
    if luffy%2 != 0:
        # Condition 2: is the number a multiple of 3?
        if luffy%3 == 0:
            print(luffy, 'is an odd number and a multiple of 3')
# Long live king of pirates
```
