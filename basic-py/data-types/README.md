# DATA TYPES IN PYTHON
| Data types | Examples |
| --- | --- |
| Text type | ```str``` |
| Numeric type | ```int```, ```float```, ```complex``` |
| Sequence type | ```list```, ```tuple```, ```range``` |
| Mapping type | ```dict``` |
| Set type | ```set```, ```frozenset``` |
| Boolean type | ```bool``` |
| Binary type | ```bytes```, ```bytearray```, ```memoryview``` |
| None type | ```NoneType``` |

```str``` = text as usual

```int``` = integers (bilangan bulat)

```float``` = decimals

```complex``` = complex number and scientific notations (2.5E-2 = 0.025 = 2.5*10^(-2))

```range``` = series of sequential integers begins from 0, with increments of 1, for example: 0, 1, 2, 3, ... 

```list```, ```tuple```, ```set```, ```frozenset```, and ```dict``` needs a page to explain the differences between them.

```bool``` = boolean, only True or False (with capital T and F)

Still not sure about ```bytes```, ```bytearray```, and ```memoryview```. Will come back to these later.

```NoneType``` = object that indicates no value
